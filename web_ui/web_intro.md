# MLA-V3 Web UI User Guide

## Overview

MLA-V3 Web UI provides an intuitive graphical interface for interacting with Agents and managing task files.

## Interface Layout

The interface is divided into two main areas:

### Left Panel: Chat Area
- **Conversation Interface**: Real-time interaction with Agents
- **Message Stream**: Displays Agent responses, tool calls, and task progress
- **Input Box**: Enter task instructions and replies

### Right Panel: File Browser Area
- **File Browsing**: View all files in the current workspace
- **File Upload**: Upload files to the current workspace
- **File Download**: Download files from the workspace
- **Real-time Updates**: Files created or modified by Agents are displayed in real-time

## Usage Workflow
